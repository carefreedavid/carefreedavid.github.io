	<h2> Step 1: Reflection </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			http://www.humanventures.co/
		</li>

		<li>
			This site has not quite inspired my design directly. But its cleanness and ability to do exactly what it needs to has helped me to keep my eye on the prize in terms of web design. 
		</li>

		<li>
			As I said above this design is really really clean. But what I like most is that it does not allow the user to venture too far off the sites intended purpose. Which is to direct the user to a sign up section. The user still feels in control while still clearly being directed to a conclusion. 
		</li>

		<li>
			With my design the brief limited my freedom a little bit. I needed to make my site to look like a newspaper, but This design section has made me reconsider my design. It seems that I have a long weekend of coding ahead of me. 
		</li>

		<li>
			Floating elements in the exact way was maybe my biggest challenge. But once I learnt the technique I was able to comfortably manage the design of my site. Making the page look like a newspaper limited the amount of freedom of design and meant I needed to push design conventions to their boundaries in terms of spacing. 
		</li>

		<li>
			To be honest making my project responsive helped me to learn that a mobile first approach is by far the most efficient way to design a site.

		<h2> Step 2: Review </h2>
		<h3> Group 1: <a href=http://squarespace.com/home/overview/> Squarespace </a></h3>
		<h3> Layout </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Instantly when landing on the page you see that the layout is clean. In this cleanliness you can very quickly learn what the site is about and can be convinced of its content.
			</li>

			<li>
				I feel as if the site is using the “divine rule” to define is landing page’s layout. The focal point is clean image of a laptop on the right of the page. Which seems to be situated in position that agrees with the ratio set out by the golden rule. 
			</li>

			<li>
				This has resulted in a lot of open space. But you do not feel as if this is a really effective use of empty space to ensure the ficus is on the beautiful imagery. 
			</li>

			<li>
				layout is completely responsive.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> Typography </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
				They use a very simple san serif font. This allows for the focus to be on the layout of the site. Which in the case of squarespace is what is what they want the user to focus on. The font size is small. Because again the focal point is the design and layout of the site.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3> Navigation </h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
				The navigation bar is very simple. With large spacing between the navigation links. I feel this is really effective because smaller spaces would have made the site feel as if there was too much wasted space. So it almost counter balances the lack of content in the body
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3> Overall Flow </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					 The slide layout of the site allows for a very very smooth flow. Scrolling down takes you to the next point of interest. This allows for the focus to be completely on what each div/section is focusing on. Allowing very clear communication of content. The only critique of the flow is that when navigating down the slides there is no way to quickly navigate to certain slides. 
				</li>
			</ul>
	</div>

	<div id="third">
		<h3> Group 2: <a href= http://mimarch.net/> mimarch.net </a> </h3>
		<h3> Layout </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The landing page of this site takes you to a page split into thirds. It is made up into two equally sized “div” like containers framing a middle section. But after inspecting the element it is actually not seperated into seperate divs, rather in a single div with a row style formatting. Anyway, The middle section contains two images. Which extends above the other two rows. This looks messy and breaks the design of the page. There is no clear focal point of the site. The three rows are fairly distracting and I find it pretty difficult to focus on any particular point which is disorientating. I would center the imagery and have the different sections displayed on
			</li>
		</ul>


		<h3> Typography </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
				The site again uses the popular San Serif for its typography. I feel personally that the selection of font-family may have not been thought out too much. The font has no character. The curvature of a serif font may have added making the font more serious and even more legible. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3> Navigation </h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
				The navigation bar is tiny and in the top right corner. They could have benefitted from centering the nav. This would have  shown off more what the site has to offer. I feel now I need to search to know what the site is offering. And that is counter productive
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3> Overall Flow </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					 The overall flow of the site is poor. After the rows you scroll down to poorly organized slides. These are stacked like a table. Each slide’s layout is poor and this makes the overall flow feel disjointed and disorganized. Somewhat chaotic.  An eas fix for this would be to expand each slide and scrolling down takes you to the next slide. Allowing the user to focus on a single slide at a time. This would generate flow as the user focusses on each section one at a time. 
				</li>
			</ul>
