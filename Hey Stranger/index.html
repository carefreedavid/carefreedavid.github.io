        Hey stranger
      </p>

        <p>
          You’re not from around here, are you?
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ve probably not been here for long, but we’ve been here forever. Our goal is to promote the underground music scene in Cape Town to those who would not have previously been able to find it. We are hoping that through ground level promotion we can promote and nourish the music scene in our beautiful city.

          This is your local guide to the coolest events in Cape Town. We’ve heard all the whispers and the secrets. We’re here to show you things that your tour guide hasn’t even seen. Basically we are your personal road to the inner circle of Cape Tonian parties.

          Our boxes with flyers are strategically placed all over the city at venues who we believe encompass the same values as we do. So go,  find them and pick up one of our envelopes. Follow us on social media. Visit our webpage. All of your nightlife needs are taken care of.
